# country musicifier

A quick script to assist in scraping lyrics from [CowboyLyrics.com](https://www.cowboylyrics.com).

It lets me pick songs on a URL-by-URL basis, then scrapes out the lyrics, renders them lowercase, and writes them all to a local file.

(Why in god's name would I need to do this? To gather various corpuses of country lyrics for various machine-learning experiments, *but of course*.)
